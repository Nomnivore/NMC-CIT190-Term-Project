# SlidingPic

## Objective

The goal of this game is to rearrange the pieces of the picture
back into the correct order. The pieces are arranged in a grid
pattern, and each piece can only be moved to the empty space.

## How to play

Click on a piece to move it into the empty space.

If you get stuck, you can click "Reset" to randomize and start over again.

Use your own pictures! Upload a PNG or JPG file using the button below the grid,
and the game will turn it into a puzzle. Square ratio pictures will work best.

The "Show Hints" button can be used to toggle index numbers for each piece. You can
use this to help you solve the puzzle, by rearranging the pieces in numeric order,
left to right then top to bottom.

## Current problems or issues
The current version of the game is free of most bugs I am aware of.
When you move the final piece of the puzzle into the right space,
it appears to slide towards another piece for a second before snapping back to its correct place.
I'm not sure exactly how to fix this, but I could try disabling animation after
the game is complete.

## Plans for future releases
Some ideas for future updates:
    - Include more than one default picture for the user to choose from
    - Show the full picture before/after attempting the puzzle
