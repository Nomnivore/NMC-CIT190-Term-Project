# Traffic Trial

## Objective
Dodge as many cars as you can as you speed along the highway.
Be careful, they are terrible drivers! They will swerve and change
lanes without any warning. How far can you get without crashing?

# How to play
Click "Start Game" to load and restart the game. <br>
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to drive and steer your car. <br>

## Current problems or issues
Collision detection feels a little inconsistent. It could be due the empty space
in the corners of the images colliding. In this case, it would not appear to collide
to the user while it technically did. If collision detection could be done in a
rounded/oval bounding box, that would be better overall.

## Plans for future releases
Some ideas for future updates:
    - Track high score, and display that score on the game screen or page
    - Add on-screen controls or support additional control schemes for keyboards
        without traditional arrow keys
    - Add speed or density modifiers that increase the game's difficulty as you progress
